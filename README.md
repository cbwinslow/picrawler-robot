# PiCrawler Robot Project

This repository contains the code and configuration for the PiCrawler robot, built around a Raspberry Pi 5 and the SunFounder Robot HAT.

## Project Goals:
- Develop a robust and intelligent robot with advanced AI capabilities.
- Implement hardware control for motors, sensors, camera, and audio.
- Integrate computer vision for face recognition and environmental awareness.
- Develop a memory system to store learned facts, faces, and environmental features.
- Create a personality and interactive interface with TTS/STT.
- Implement a continuous learning loop for autonomous exploration and adaptation.
- Establish a resilient deployment and update mechanism using GitHub and Cloudflare Tunnel.
- Ensure comprehensive observability and automation for optimal operation.

## Setup Instructions:
